    - examples 
        - toric-code 
        - graph-code 
    - properties 
        - some properties are mentioned already in the refs
        - [ ] add to note the properties about degeneracy of the eigenspectrum of a general stabilizer hamiltonian , and ho that related to the logical space of the corresponding stabilizer code .
        - [ ] action of paulis and pauli-exponentials on stabilizer-hamiltonians (ref. [[notes/mbqc-vqe/mbqc-vqe-v0.1|mbqc-vqe-v0.1]]) 
            - [ ] or [[notes/mbqc-vqe/mbqc-vqe-v0.2#^67a5f5|perturbative analysis on stabilizer hamiltonians]] ?
        - [ ] should we include [[notes/mbqc-vqe/TrackingStabilizerStates-under-PauliExponentiation|TrackingStabilizerStates-under-PauliExponentiation]] ? 
### [[dailynotes/09-01-2025|09-01-2025]]

- make all the sections and subsections of that the skeleton of the document is fixed from the beginning 
- for the sections on which extensive literature is already available insert the references directly under the section titles instead of putting it in the note. for eg. 
    - stabilizer groups 
    - basic structure and examples of stabilizer hamiltonians 
- [ ] deciding to elabiorate the main ideas using the example on bell-states, i'll alos introduce the idea of logical operators
