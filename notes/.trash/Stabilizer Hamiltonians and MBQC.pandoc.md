**Notation :** Given two pauli operators on n-qubits []{.math
.math-inline .is-loaded} they can either commute or anti-commute and we
will use the notation []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} as []{.math
.math-block .is-loaded}to indicate their inter-commutation relation.

#### Isomorphism of Pauli Operators {#isomorphism-of-pauli-operators heading="Isomorphism of Pauli Operators" dir="auto"}

We know that for single qubits there are three n on-trivial pauli
operators namely []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}. However as will be
apparent in the later sections it is often convenient to use the fact
that []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}, to say that []{.math
.math-inline .is-loaded} is generated by the elements []{.math
.math-inline .is-loaded} upto an overall phase (i.e if we ignore the
[]{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}). This fact allows us to say that for
a 1-qubit system where the hilbert space is two-dimensional we have two
\"independent\" pauli operators that are []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded}, where the notion of independence corresponds to the fact
that the []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} cannot be expressed as a
scalar-multiple of []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} or vice versa,
whereas []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} can be.

Similarly for a n-qubit system we can construct respective pauli
operators by taking n-tensor products of the single qubit pauli
operators as []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}, for example []{.math
.math-inline .is-loaded}. Generalizing the result before we can see that
an []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} qubit system must have []{.math
.math-inline .is-loaded} many \'independent\' pauli operators,
represented as []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}. Observe that they must
satisfy the commutation relation []{.math .math-block .is-loaded},which
we will refer to as the \'canonical commutation relation\' and is easy
to deduce from the fact that the pauli operators only interact
non-trivially when they\'re acting on the same qubit and thus must
commute otherwise (remember []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}).

We can define a canonical transformation []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded} which transforms the independent pauli operators to
independent pauli-operators as []{.math .math-block .is-loaded} where
[]{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}. Note that []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded} are not necessarily single qubits operators unlike []{.math
.math-inline .is-loaded}, but could be any element from []{.math
.math-inline .is-loaded} as long as they satisfy the commutation
relation. For example we can define the following transformation on
[]{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} []{.math .math-block .is-loaded},
where the the operators []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} are mapped to
non-local pauli-operators. All such pauli groups generated via
canonical-transformations are called \"isomorphic\" and such
transformations are called \"Clifford\" transformations, something we
will come back to later.

#### Stabilizer States {#stabilizer-states heading="Stabilizer States" dir="auto"}

For any []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}-qubit system, a state []{.math
.math-inline .is-loaded} is called a stabilizer state if we can find
[]{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} \'independent\' and \'commuting\'
pauli operators []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} such that []{.math
.math-inline .is-loaded}

For convenience we can use the notation []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded} to refer to a stabilizer state stabilized by []{.math
.math-inline .is-loaded}.

From the properties of pauli operators discussed above its easy to see
the for corresponding to any set of n independent and commuting pauli
operators []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} we must have a complementary
set of n independent and commuting operators []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded} such that for every element of []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded} there exists exactly one element in []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded} that anti-commutes with it. This relation can be
encapsulated by recognizing the paulis in []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded} and []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} with []{.math
.math-inline .is-loaded} and []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}
respectively, (i.e []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded})

#### Action of Pauli operators on Stabilizer States {#action-of-pauli-operators-on-stabilizer-states heading="Action of Pauli operators on Stabilizer States" dir="auto"}

Since []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} []{.math .math-block
.is-loaded}the only paulis that act non-trivially (i.e not equivalent
upto overall phase) on the stabilizer state []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded} must be elements of the set []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded}.

The pauli []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} anticommutes exclusively
with []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}, thus it should transform the
state []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} in manner that measuring the
[]{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} on this transformed state must yield
[]{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}, however measuring any of []{.math
.math-inline .is-loaded} should still yield []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded}, since they commute with []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}.

This allows us to represent the transformation induced by []{.math
.math-inline .is-loaded} as []{.math .math-block .is-loaded} Similarly,
transformation induced by any arbitrary operator of the form []{.math
.math-inline .is-loaded} can be easily obtained as []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded}

Also note that any two stabilizer states on which differ by the action
of a non-trivial pauli must by orthogonal to each other, this can be
seen from the expectation values of []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} in
[]{.math .math-block .is-loaded}where []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}
is such that []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}. (that there will exist a
[]{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} like this follows from the fact that
[]{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} is non-trivial) Since there are
[]{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} such non-trivial operators in []{.math
.math-inline .is-loaded}, we can generate []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded} mutually orthogonal stabilizer states by acting []{.math
.math-inline .is-loaded} with the operators in []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded} which will be of the form []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}.
( ) Thus we can use this \'stabilizer-basis\' to represent any arbitrary
state in the n-qubits hilbert space []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}.

Realize that the mostly commonly used computational basis state []{.math
.math-inline .is-loaded} is also a \'stabilizer-basis\' where we have
restricted all the stabilizer operators []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded} to be acting on the physical []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded}th qubit imposing []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} to yield
the basis []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}. For an example, the state
[]{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} can equivalently represented as
[]{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}. A key thing to note is that in
general an arbitrary linear composition of different stabilizer states
is not a stabilizer state, in the previous example the state []{.math
.math-inline .is-loaded} is not stabilized by either []{.math
.math-inline .is-loaded} for arbitrary choices of []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded}.

#### Example: Bell State {#example-bell-state heading="Example: Bell State" dir="auto"}

The bell state or more generally the bell basis is characterized by the
stabilizer generators []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}, the
corresponding stabilizer-state is []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}. It
is easy to see that both the stabilizers generators yield an eigenvalue
[]{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} on the state []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded}.

Question is how can we generate the entire basis for the two-qubit
hilbert space []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} ? We can try
investigating this by redefining a set of four stabilizer generators as
[]{.math .math-block .is-loaded}. Where for any []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded} the structure of the generators []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded} indicate the measurement outcome we should get upon
measuring each individual generator, for instance a state []{.math
.math-inline .is-loaded} stabilized by []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}
should satisfy the conditions []{.math .math-block .is-loaded}. But how
do we guess that state []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} (or any
[]{.math .math-inline .is-loaded})? Remember from the previous example
that if we define []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} we can have []{.math
.math-inline .is-loaded} such that []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}, we
can use this property to write []{.math .math-block .is-loaded} thus
obtaining an orthogonal basis for the 2-qubit hilbert space []{.math
.math-inline .is-loaded}.

#### Partially Stabilized States {#partially-stabilized-states heading="Partially Stabilized States" dir="auto"}

Up until now we discuss stabilizer states which were fully stabilized in
the sense that we had n independent generators for an n qubit system.
However for most practical circumstances we will be interested in states
which are only partially stabilized i.e will have []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded} independent generators instead. On a []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded} qubit system with any state []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded} with []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} independent
stabilizer-generators []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} will be spanned
by []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} basis vectors of the form []{.math
.math-inline .is-loaded}.

For instance, consider a 3 qubit system, on which the stabilizer
generators are defined as []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}, just like
before we can recognize the elements in []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded} as []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}. We can complete the
[]{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} pauli-operators by picking []{.math
.math-inline .is-loaded} and then pick the []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded} operators as []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} such that the
canonical commutation relations ([]{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}) are
satisfied. Any state []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} that is
\'partially-stabilized\' by []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} must be
spanned by the linear combination of []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}
i.e []{.math .math-block .is-loaded}for arbitrary []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded}. Realize that even though the system has 3 physical qubits,
in essence the state []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} is spanned by
just two basis vectors and thus is an element of a hilbert-space
[]{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} and thus is equivalent to single
qubit. In the refs. this fact is referred to as []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded} encoding just one \'logical qubit\'.

For any system of []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}
stabilizer-generators on an []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}
dimensional system, we can have a logical space of []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded} qubits (i.e of dim []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}) ,
correspondingly there will be []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}
independent pauli-operators that commute with paulis in []{.math
.math-inline .is-loaded} we will indicate as []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded}. In the above example []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given Stabilizer Group (i.e a commuting set of pauli) we can always
construct a stabilizer hamiltonian of the form []{.math .math-block
.is-loaded}. We can probe into the eigen spectrum of the hamiltonian by
using few simple properties. Any state []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}
we have []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} or []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded} since []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} , thus []{.math
.math-block .is-loaded} where []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} and
[]{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}. If we have []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded} generators (i.e []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}) , then
[]{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} has []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}
distinct eigenvalues of the form []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}. We
can enumerate the eigenvalues simply by choosing the number of
stabilizers []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} that are in their []{.math
.math-inline .is-loaded} eigenspace i.e we can partition the stabilizer
generators as []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} where the set []{.math
.math-inline .is-loaded} and []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}
correspond to the set of stabilizers with +1 and -1 eigenspace
respectively, the energy configuration can be represented compactly as
[]{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} . So if []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded} we know that []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} and []{.math
.math-inline .is-loaded} where there are []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded} many configurations corresponding to the energy level
[]{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}. Further since an energy configuration
[]{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} only specifies the state of []{.math
.math-inline .is-loaded} stabilizer-measurements the corresponding
eigenspace has a degeneracy equivalent to the []{.math .math-inline
.is-loaded} dimensional logical space.

From the section
[](/home/rpal/Documents/INRIAProjectVault/shared-repos/mb-vqa/notes/index.html#Action%20of%20Pauli%20operators%20on%20Stabilizer%20States.md){.internal-link}[\#Action](/home/rpal/Documents/INRIAProjectVault/shared-repos/mb-vqa/notes/index.html#Action){.tag}
of Pauli operators on Stabilizer States we can see that any eigenstate
of []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} corresponding to the energy
configuration []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} would transform under
the action of pauli operator []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} would
transform to another state that has the energy configuration is []{.math
.math-inline .is-loaded} where []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} is
addition modulo 2 (aka XOR addition).

**Example :** For Bell states, []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} ,
realize that the state []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} corresponds to
the energy configuration []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}. And has the
following eigen-decomposition. []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded},
[]{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} ,[]{.math .math-inline .is-loaded}.

### Effect of Perturbation on Stabilizer Hamiltonians {#effect-of-perturbation-on-stabilizer-hamiltonians heading="Effect of Perturbation on Stabilizer Hamiltonians" dir="auto"}

Now that we understand a bit about the structure of the eigenspectrum of
stabilizer hamiltonians we can look into how their eigenspaces are
modified under the influence of external perturbations. Any generic
perturbations represented as the weighted sum of pauli operators as
[]{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} where the weights []{.math
.math-inline .is-loaded} indicate the strength of the perturbations and
are usually of small magnitude. For most physically inspired problems of
interest the error operators []{.math .math-inline .is-loaded} are
single qubit paulis, (for instance the problems in
