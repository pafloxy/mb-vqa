### lit-review
- t-doped paper: was not super good because they were too theoretical 
- read the papers by Dellantonio, question about the choice of ansatz still persisits 

### todo 
- try small examples, on understanding  gflow , especially how to extract paulis so that we know what kind of unitaries it might implement.
    - Will Simmons paper has some tricks called 'pauli-extractions'
    - Luis's thesis does some things 
- trying to simulate examples from Luis's thesis 
    - understand the role of SOP (string -order- paramter) in the work 
    - understand his ansatz (MuTA), then we can try to generalize the ansatz using things we learned from PGA
    - he has code already (maybe ? else we use graphix )
