## Project Repository for Internship 


I have inlcuded some notes to get you started for the project :), you can find it at [Main Note.md](notes/Main%20Note.md). 

>Currently the notes are still uder development and we will keep updating them.

### Method ...
- If you are facing difficulty understanding a concept either from the notes or the references, you can raise a github issue.
- might use the templates :
    - title: [Concept][name of concept] 
    - body: description of the problem, 
    - consider including the reference to the section in the notes or the paper you might be reading 

We will then try to communicate on the resolve, by updating the notes. This way its easier to keep track of the questions, as often they become important later on :)
