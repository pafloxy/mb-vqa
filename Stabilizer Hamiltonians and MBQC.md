**Notation :** Given two pauli operators on n-qubits $A,B \in \mathcal{P}^{\otimes n}$ they can either commute or anti-commute and we will use the notation $\odot$ as $$A \odot B = \begin{cases} 0 \: ; [A,B] =0 \\ 1 \: ; [A,B] \neq 0 \end{cases} $$to indicate their inter-commutation relation. 

#### Isomorphism of Pauli Operators
We know that for single qubits there are three non-trivial pauli operators namely $\mathcal{P}^{\otimes 1} = \{I, X, Y ,Z\}$. However as will be apparent in the later sections it is often convenient to use the fact that $Y = i ZX$, to say that $\mathcal{P}^{\otimes1}$ is generated by the elements $X,Z$ upto an overall phase (i.e if we ignore the $i$). This fact allows us to say that for a 1-qubit system where the hilbert space is two-dimensional we have two "independent" pauli operators that are $X,Z$, where the notion of independence corresponds to the fact that the $Z$ cannot be expressed as a scalar-multiple of $X$ or vice versa, whereas $Y$ can be. 

Similarly for a n-qubit system we can construct respective pauli operators by taking n-tensor products of the single qubit pauli operators as $\mathcal{P}^{\otimes n} = \bigotimes_{i=1}^{n}\mathcal{P}^{\otimes 1}$, for example $\mathcal{P}^{\otimes2}=\{I, X_{0}, Z_{0},Y_{0}\}\otimes \{I, X_{1}, Z_{1}, Y_{1}\}$. Generalizing the result before we can see that an $n$ qubit system must have $2n$ many 'independent' pauli operators, represented as $\{X_{0}, Z_{0}, X_{1}, Z_{1} \dots X_{n}, Z_{n}\}$. Observe that they must satisfy the commutation relation $$X_{i} \odot Z_{j}= \delta_{ij}$$,which we will refer to as the 'canonical commutation relation' and is easy to deduce from the fact that the pauli operators only interact non-trivially when they're acting on the same qubit and thus must commute otherwise (remember $X_{i}= I_1 \otimes \dots \otimes X_{i} \otimes \dots I_n$). 

We can define a canonical transformation $T: \mathcal{P}^{\otimes n} \to \mathcal{P}^{\otimes n}$ which transforms the independent pauli operators to independent pauli-operators as 
$$\begin{align} \forall_{i=1}^{n} \:\:\: X_{i} \to \tilde{X_{i}}\:; \: Z_{i}\to \tilde{Z_i}\end{align}$$where $\tilde{X_{i}} \otimes \tilde{Z_{j}} = \delta_{ij}$. Note that $\tilde{X_{i}}, \tilde{Z_{i}}$ are not necessarily single qubits operators unlike $X_{i}, Z_{i}$, but could be any element from $\mathcal{P}^{\otimes n}$ as long as they satisfy the commutation relation. 
For example we can define the following transformation on $\mathcal{P}^{\otimes 2}$ $$\begin{align} Z_{1} \to X_{1}X_{2} \:&;\: Z_{2}\to Z_{1}Z_{2} \\ X_{1} \to Z1 \:&; \: X_{2} \to X_1 \end{align}$$, where the the operators $Z_{1}, Z_{2}$ are mapped to non-local pauli-operators. All such pauli groups generated via canonical-transformations are called "isomorphic" and such transformations are called "Clifford" transformations, something we will come back to later. 

#### Stabilizer States

For any $n$-qubit system, a state $\ket{\psi}$ is called a stabilizer state if we can find $n$ 'independent' and 'commuting' pauli operators $\mathcal{S} = \{S_{1}, S_{2}, \dots S_{n}\} \subset \mathcal{P}^{\otimes n}$ such that $\forall_{S \in \braket{\mathcal{S}}} \: S \ket{\psi} = \ket{\psi}$ 

For convenience we can use the notation $\ket{\mathcal{S}} = \ket{S_{1}S_{2} \dots S_n}$ to refer to a stabilizer state stabilized by $\braket{\mathcal{S}}$.  

From the properties of pauli operators discussed above its easy to see the for corresponding to any set of n independent and commuting pauli operators $\mathcal{S}$ we must have a complementary set of n independent and commuting operators $\mathcal{S}^c$ such that for every element of $\mathcal{S}$ there exists exactly one element in $\mathcal{S}^c$ that anti-commutes with it. This relation can be encapsulated by recognizing the paulis in $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{S}^{c}$ with $\mathcal{\tilde{Z}}$ and $\mathcal{\tilde{X}}$ respectively, (i.e $S_{i}\to \tilde{Z}_{i}\:, \: S^{c}_{i} \to \tilde{X}_{i}$)
#### Action of Pauli operators on Stabilizer States
Since $\forall_{i} \: \tilde{Z}_{i} \ket{\tilde{\mathcal{Z}}} = \ket{\tilde{\mathcal{Z}}}$ the only paulis that act non-trivially on the stabilizer state $\ket{\mathcal{\tilde{Z}}}$ must be elements of the set $\mathcal{\tilde{X}}$. The pauli $\tilde{X}_i$ anticommutes exclusively with $\tilde{Z}_{i}$, thus it should transform the state $\ket{\mathcal{\tilde{Z}}}$ in manner that measuring the $\tilde{Z}_i$ on this transformed state must yield $-1$, however measuring any of $\forall_{j \neq i} \:\tilde{Z}_{j}$ should still yield $+1$, since they commute with $\tilde{X}_i$. 

This allows us to represent the transformation induced by $\tilde{X}_{i}$ as $$\tilde{X}_{i} \ket{\tilde{Z}_{1}.. \tilde{Z}_{i}\dots \tilde{Z}_{n}}  \: = \: \ket{\tilde{Z}_{1}.. -\tilde{Z}_{i}\dots \tilde{Z}_{n}}$$ Similarly, transformation induced by any arbitrary operator of the form $\tilde{X} = \tilde{X}_{i}\tilde{X}_{j} ..\tilde{X}_k$ can be easily obtained as $\tilde{X} \ket{\tilde{\mathcal{Z}}} = \ket{ \forall_{i} \: (-1)^{\tilde{X} \odot \tilde{Z}_i}\tilde{Z}_{i}}$

Also note that any two stabilizer states on which differ by the action of a non-trivial pauli must by orthogonal to each other, this can be seen from the expectation values of $\braket{\tilde{\mathcal{Z}}| \tilde{X}|\tilde{\mathcal{Z}}}$ in $$\begin{align} 2\braket{\tilde{\mathcal{Z}}| \tilde{X}|\tilde{\mathcal{Z}}} &= \braket{\tilde{\mathcal{Z}}| \tilde{X}|\tilde{\mathcal{Z}}} +\braket{\tilde{\mathcal{Z}}| \tilde{X}\tilde{Z}_i|\tilde{\mathcal{Z}}} \\ &= \braket{\tilde{\mathcal{Z}}| \tilde{X}|\tilde{\mathcal{Z}}} -\braket{\tilde{\mathcal{Z}}| \tilde{Z}_i\tilde{X}|\tilde{\mathcal{Z}}} \\ &= 0\end{align}$$where $\tilde{Z}_i$ is such that $\tilde{Z}_{i}\odot \tilde{X}=1$. (that there will exist a $\tilde{Z}_i$ like this follows from the fact that $\tilde{X}$ is non-trivial)

#### Stabilizer States as basis for hilbert space
$\{\ket{\pm Z_{1} ..\pm Z_{n}}\}$


#### Example: Bell State 

The bell state or more generally the bell basis is characterized by the stabilizer generators $\mathcal{S}_{\beta_{00}}= \{X_{0}X_{1}, Z_{0}Z_{1} \}$, the corresponding stabilizer-state is $\ket{\beta_{00}} = \ket{00} + \ket{11}$. It is easy to see that both the stabilizers generators yield an eigenvalue $+1$ on the state $\ket{\beta_{00}}$. 

Question is how can we generate the entire basis for the two-qubit hilbert space $\mathcal{H}^{\otimes2^2 }$ ? We can try investigating this by redefining a set of four stabilizer generators as $$\mathcal{S}_{\beta_{ij}} = \{ -1^{i}X_{0}X_{1},-1^{j} Z_{0}Z_{1} \} $$. Where for any $i,j$ the structure of the generators $\mathcal{S}_{\beta_{ij}}$ indicate the measurement outcome we should get upon measuring each individual generator, for instance a state $\ket{\beta_{01}}$ stabilized by $\mathcal{S}_{\beta_{01}}$ should satisfy the conditions $$X_0X_{1}\ket{\beta_{01}}= \ket{\beta_{01}} \:; \: Z_0Z_{1}\ket{\beta_{01}}= -\ket{\beta_{01}}$$. 
But how doe we guess that state $\ket{\beta_{01}}$ (or any $\ket{\beta_{ij}}$)? Remember from the previous example that if we define $\tilde{Z_{0}}=X_0X_{1} , \tilde{Z_{1}}= Z_{0}Z_{1}$ we can have $\tilde{X_{0}}=Z_{1}, \tilde{X_{1}}=X_1$ such that $\forall_{i=0,1} \: \tilde{Z_{i}} \odot \tilde{X_{j}} = \delta_{ij}$.

### Properties of Stabilizer Hamiltonian

Given Stabilizer Group (i.e a commuting set of pauli) we can always construct a stabilizer hamiltonian of the form 
$$H_{\mathcal{S}}= - \sum\limits_{S \in \mathcal{S}} S$$. We can probe into the eigen spectrum of the hamiltonian by using few simple properties. Any state $\ket{\psi}$ we have $S \ket{\psi} =\ket{\psi}$ or $S \ket{\psi}=-\ket{\psi}$ since $S \in \mathbb{P}^{\otimes{n}}$ , thus $$H_{\mathcal{S}}\ket{\psi}=- \sum\limits_{S \in \mathcal{S}}S \ket{\psi} = - \sum\limits_{S\in \mathcal{S}} (-1)^{\psi_{S}}\: \ket{\psi}$$  where $S \ket{\psi} = \psi_{S}\ket{\psi}$. If we have $k$ generators (i.e $|\mathcal{S}|=k$) , then $H_{\mathcal{S}}$ has $\frac{(k+1)!}{k! 1!}=k$ distinct eigenvalues of the form $\lambda(H_{\mathcal{S}}) =\{k, k-2, \dots ,-k\}$. We can enumerate the eigenvalues simply by choosing the number of stabilizers $S \in \mathcal{S}$ that are in their $+1$ eigenspace, i.e we can partition the stabilizer generators as $\mathcal{S} = \mathcal{S^{+}} \cup \mathcal{S^{-}}$ where the set $\mathcal{S^+}$ and $\mathcal{S^{-}}$ correspond to the set of stabilizers with +1 and -1 eigenspace respectively. So if $\lambda(H_{\mathcal{S}}) = E$ we know that $|\mathcal{S^{+}|}= \frac{E+k}{2}$ and $\mathcal{S^-}=\frac{-E+k}{2}$. 
It is easy to see that the eigen

It is easy to see that the eigen-spectrum of the corresponding hamiltonian is degenerate, and we can find all the eigenstates  corresponding to a 


### Effect of Perturbation on Stabilizer Hamiltonians
Now that we understand a bit about the structure of the eigenspectrum of stabilizer hamiltonians we can look into how their eigenspaces are modified under the influence of external perturbations. Any generic perturbations represented as the weighted sum of pauli operators as $H_{\delta} = \lambda_{1}E_{1} + \lambda_{2}E_{2} + \dots$ where the weights $\lambda$ indicate the strength of the perturbations and are usually of small magnitude. For most physically inspired problems of interest the error operators $E_{1}, E_{2} \dots$ are single qubit paulis, (for instance the problems in [[ReadingDocuments/VQE-InfusedCircuitMBQC@LDellantonio24.pdf|VQE-InfusedCircuitMBQC@LDellantonio24]], [[ReadingDocuments/VQE-MBQC@RFegurson21.pdf|VQE-MBQC@RFegurson21]], etc.) However we are
